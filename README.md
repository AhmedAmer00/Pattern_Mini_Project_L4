Sign_Language_Recognition 

in this article, we will classify the sign language symbols using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After successful training of the CNN model, the corresponding alphabet of a sign language symbol will be predicted.

we have used the American Sign Language (ASL) data set that is provided by MNIST and it is publicly available at Kaggle. This dataset contains 27455 training images and 7172 test images all with a shape of 28 x 28 pixels. These images belong to the 25 classes of English alphabet starting from A to Y (No class labels for Z because of gesture motions). The dataset on Kaggle is available in the CSV format where training data has 27455 rows and 785 columns. The first column of the dataset represents the class label of the image and the remaining 784 columns represent the 28 x 28 pixels. The same paradigm is followed by the test data set.
